# Code-settings

My new code settings repository because:

- [Shan's setting sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) is deprecated. Old config can be found here: [Mastermindzh/cloudSettings](https://gist.github.com/Mastermindzh/391b93811f5748f09110fee35fee0d05)
- Built-in settings sync uses dedicated servers that are not under my control and the uploaded files can't be inspected/shared.
- New setup uses: https://github.com/zokugun/vscode-sync-settings
